# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## Primary Objetive:

To build Classification methodology to predict whether or not a person has diabetes.

## Soluton :

 I created a web app that takes the information provided by the client, processes it, and informs him if has diabetes or not. the entire system is built on  `python`, `SVM classifier` in machine learning algorithm and `flask`


## Life cycle of the project

- Data scraping
- Data cleaning
- Data preparation
- Model building and evaluation
